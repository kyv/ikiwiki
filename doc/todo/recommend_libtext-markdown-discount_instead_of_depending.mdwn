Would you consider Recommending `libtext-markdown-discount` instead of
depending on it?  It isn't available in wheezy, and the sid version is the
wrong side of a perl transition, unfortunately.  This is the only
dependency preventing the stock sid version of ikiwiki from being
installable on a wheezy host. -- [[Jon]]
